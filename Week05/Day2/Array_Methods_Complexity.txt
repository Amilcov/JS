Array practice
Identify the time complexity of each of these functions with a 1 sentence justification for your answer. Assume arr is an array of length n.

arr.push()
Time complexity: O(1) Space complexity: O(n) Justification: Fill this in

//Time: because JS ask for more memoery that it is used and mark those as <empty>
//Space: because need space for n elements



arr.pop()
Time complexity: O(1) Space complexity: O(1) Justification: Fill this in
//Time: No time used to mark an elem as <empty>
//Space: because no need for more space


arr.shift()
Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Justification: Fill this in
//Time: need to move/copy all elements (move to the left)
//Space: because no need for more space

arr.unshift()
Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Justification: Fill this in
//Time: need to move/copy all elements (move to the right)
//Space: because  need  1 more space 



arr.splice()
Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Justification: Fill this in
//Time: need to move/copy all elements (move to the right)
//Space: because  need for more space the insert newly added elems



arr.slice()
Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Justification: Fill this in
//Time: need to copy all elements into a new array
//Space: because need space for the new array


arr.indexOf()
Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Justification: Fill this in
//Time: sesarch all n elem  
//Space: no space require


arr.map()
Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Justification: Fill this in
//Time: need to copy all elements into a new array
//Space: because need space for the new array


arr.filter()
Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Justification: Fill this in
//Time: need to copy all elements into a new array
//Space: because need space for the new array

arr.reduce()
Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Justification: Fill this in
//Time: need to read all elements into a new array
//Space: because no  need  for extra space 


arr.reverse()
Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(1) Justification: Fill this in
//Time: need to copy all elements into a new array
//Space:take new space but then released 


[...arr]
Time complexity: O(n) Space complexity: O(n) Justification: Fill this in
//Time: need to read all elements 
//Space: take n space
